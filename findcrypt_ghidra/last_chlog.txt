Hello FC-G people!

WARNING: Mandatory script update (database structure change).

With this update I'm bringing the compression for the database (GZip) which is a necessary function
for the next updates.
First of all, I tested the new script (and the old one) on a Linux Ghidra instance and it's working
wonderfully with no problems, can't say about MacOSX since I do not own any.
As for the next EXCITING updates:

- I'll introduce the Ellpictic Curves constants, as many as possible (these are huge).
- A surprise, if I manage to do it you'll love it.

So far is already a big improvement from the original FindCrypt, really grad this is going well and 
you all liked this plugin so far.

See ya next time with more interesting stuff.

Happy hacking.
