Hello FC-G people!

WARNING: Mandatory script update (database structure change).

This update has been developed entirely by Pawlos who's been kindly helping the development of this plugin.
Briefly, what the update brings is a new database structure and a script update that brings to surface a way to scan fragments of constants.

What does this mean exactly?

It means that even if the constants are partially the same as the original algorithm's code or if these have been partially obfuscated, 
they can still be detected; all of this at the cost of a slower scan time.

Happy hacking.
