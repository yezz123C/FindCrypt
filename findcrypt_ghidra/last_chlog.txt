With the latest update, I introduced the update system.
With this new version instead, I fixed a couple of bugs and added the changelog you're reading right now.

- Added changelog to script update.
- Fixed a bug duplicating scan results (database was being loaded twice)
- The script now enforces the current version (you only need to update FindCrypt.java, 
	no need to replace the "findcrypt_ghidra" directory)

The script is in quite an ugly state (spaghetti code style by an italian coder ;) )
that is because I first wanted to create a PoC and see if people was interested.

Now, since we've a few active users, let me tell you what I'm going to do:

- I'm going to properly test the script on a Linux Ghidra instance.
- I'm going to redesign most of the code, to be sure it's not so ugly and improve
	its stability.
- I'll try to implement the compression for the database signatures.

This is all for now, I'm glad you guys like this plugin as I do.
I'm open to suggestions, you can write them in the Issues section of the repository.

Happy hacking.
